<!-- paths - absolute path & relative path 
Image that we are talkin about is entri.jpg
Relative paths
-> src="entri.jpg" - in the same folder as this file
-> src="images/entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is in the same folder as this file.
-> src="/images/entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is at the root directory
-> src="../entri.jpg" - in the images folder and images folder is one level up from the folder where this file is present.

Where are paths used in HTML?
-> images
-> style sheets(css) file
-> js file
-> external links
-> links to another html page of the same project

Example of absolute path
C:\Users\VB\Desktop\Entri\Images\entri.jpg
